[size=5][b]Overview[/b][/size]

[size=4][b][u]Summary:[/u][/b][/size]
(Adds new snap points to vanilla ship parts where it felt like they were missing. Largely stays within the grid established so far.)

It is recommended that you use another mod or adjust your INI manually ("Spaceship" section, "fShipBuilderModuleOverlapTolerance" setting) to set your tolerances to something like -1.0 (default is -0.25), otherwise some snaps may not be usable.

For flips and rotations, see another of my mods, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5953]Better Ship Part Flips[/url], or use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6029]Ship Module Snap Expansion - SMSEX[/url].

(For mod authors): Data structures modified or added: MSTT, STMP

[size=4][b][u]Compatibility:[/u][/b][/size]
Should be mostly compatible with other ship stat change mods.

Since I'm not the author of Ship Module Snap Expansion, I cannot guarantee it will be compatible to my mod, but as of Sept 28 10 2023, it was compatible in that all my snaps for vanilla parts where working but flips/rotations [b]added[/b] by Ship Module Snap Expansion [b]didn't[/b] have my snaps.

[size=4][b][u]Archive Invalidation:[/u][/b][/size]
Make sure your [font=Courier New][color=#b2b2b2]StarfieldCustom.ini[/color][/font] file in the "Documents\My Games\Starfield" folder (or your profile folder if using a mod manager and profiles) contains the following:

    [font=Courier New][color=#b2b2b2][Archive][/color][/font]
    [font=Courier New][color=#b2b2b2]bInvalidateOlderFiles=1[/color][/font]
    [font=Courier New][color=#b2b2b2]sResourceDataDirsFinal=[/color][/font]

[size=4][b][u]Requirements:[/u][/b][/size]
None, if using Starfield v1.12.32.0 or above.

[size=4][b][u]Recommendations:[/u][/b][/size]
NOTE: StarUI Ship Builder v1.2 doesn't work with Starfield v1.11.36+, so if you're running that version of the mod with that version of Starfield, you'll have to go without for the moment.

- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6402]StarUI Ship Builder[/url]: This mod arranges the categories in a vertical list and adds some filtering options, both of which greatly enhance usability.

[size=4][b][u]Upgrading:[/u][/b][/size]
When upgrading non-major versions (for example v2.something to v2.something-else), you don't need to do anything except replace the installed mod files.

When upgrading major versions (for example v1.whatever to v2.whatever), you need to do a clean install:
- Open the game and load your latest save
- Save your game, then quit
- Uninstall the previous version of the plugin and all its files
- Open the game and load your last save
- You will see a warning about missing the plugin you just uninstalled, choose to continue
- Save your game again, then quit
- Install the new version of the plugin

[size=4][b][u]Mod Manager:[/u][/b][/size]
Download and install the archive with either [url=https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer/releases]Mod Organizer 2[/url] (version 2.5.0 or later) or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1]Vortex[/url]. I personally recommend Mod Organizer 2 (with the optional [url=https://kezyma.github.io/?p=rootbuilder]Root Builder[/url] plugin to use with SFSE or any other mod that requires files be put directly in the game's installation folder).

[size=4][b][u]Manual (NOT RECOMMENDED):[/u][/b][/size]
Extract the archive to your Starfield installation's "Data" folder (typically something like "C:\Games\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Starfield\Data"). Add the plugin file names to your plugins.txt file if they aren't already there, making sure the ones you want enabled are preceded with [font=Courier New][color=#b2b2b2]*[/color][/font].
