Summary
-------
(Adds new snap points to vanilla ship parts where it felt like they were missing. Largely stays within the grid established so far.)

It is recommended that you use another mod or adjust your INI manually ("Spaceship" section, "fShipBuilderModuleOverlapTolerance" setting) to set your tolerances to something like -1.0 (default is -0.25), otherwise some snaps may not be usable.

For flips and rotations, see another of my mods, Better Ship Part Flips (https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5953), or use Ship Module Snap Expansion - SMSEX (https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6029).

(For mod authors): Data structures modified or added: MSTT, STMP

This is a limited version of the README. The full version can be found at the mod's GitHub repository (https://github.com/rux616/starfield-better-ship-part-snaps).

Compatibility
-------------
Should be mostly compatible with other ship stat change mods.

Since I'm not the author of Ship Module Snap Expansion, I cannot guarantee it will be compatible to my mod, but as of Sept 28 10 2023, it was compatible in that all my snaps for vanilla parts where working but flips/rotations **added** by Ship Module Snap Expansion **didn't** have my snaps.

Known Issues
------------
- Some Panoptes engines share snaps with their smaller counterparts, resulting in some weird snap locations.
